# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

During this project, I searched for better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. I explored the possibility of using unsupervised learning to find out if there are distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. After being provided with the raw data, I processed it to fit the machine learning models. I then used several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Next, I created a visualization to share my findings. For Part 1, I Prepared the Data. First, I read the myopia.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame. Next, I removed the "MYOPIC" column from the dataset. Then, I standardized my dataset so that columns that contain larger values do not influence the outcome more than columns with smaller values. Next, for Part 2, I applied Dimensionality Reduction. First, I performed dimensionality reduction with PCA. Next, I further reduced the dataset dimensions with t-SNE and visually inspected the results. To do this, I ran a t-SNE on the principal components, which is the output of the PCA transformation. Then, I created a scatter plot of the t-SNE output. For Part 3, I performed a Cluster Analysis with K-means. I created an elbow plot to identify the best number of clusters. Lastly, for Part 4, I made a recommendation on whether or not the patients can be clustered.
